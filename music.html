          The following is my first collection of songs I made while
          experimenting on a DAW program known as LMMS. Most of what is made
          here is made for the purposes of learning how to make music while
          applying the lessons I learned on youtube involving music theory,
          audio engineering, and unique tools I found in LMMS.

        <p id="blog_date">
          After 9 months of making music in a DAW Program, I made 14 original
          soundtracks inspired by my years studying as a dental student. The aim
          of the album is to give the experience of studying in a medical field;
          from its innocent first few years studying basic subjects that revisit
          the lessons you were taught in high school to the stressful final
          years you have as a clinician working overtime. People will come and
          go, beautiful moments will happen as well as moments of hardship, and
          you will fundamentally question the idea of when the transition
          between student and doctor truly begins (Or maybe it does not even
          happen at all).

        This video pretty much explains how I make music from start to finish.
        If you are interested in making music, I go into a summary of the DAW I
        use, the music theory lessons I've learned, and some tips to how I make
        my music a little more catchy than its earlier drafts.
