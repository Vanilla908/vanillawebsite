            <img width="1280px" class="blog_pictures" src="https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5622AQFhLleDfMmtIg/feedshare-shrink_800/B56Zs5lwkNHkAg-/0/1766197761550?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=8NEnVUnKKJs9tMONlX2BMDvDxWdM8JN_bB1rxYSgg7E" alt="">
            <p id= "recent_post" class="blog_date">For the first time, I went out of the country on Christmas break to go and visit Hong Kong and Macao! We went and
              visited a culture I've never seen before and even if me and my family had the worst of Culture shocks, I must say that the region
              is one of the most marvelous places I've ever visited. The first time I landed at the HKIA, I was greeted with a cleaner and more
              high-tech environment compared to the international airport of my homeland. When we got to the arrival gate, the entire family was hungry,
              so we started looking for a restaurant at the airport. We saw a huge Mcdonalds sign and thought that it was a real chain. Turns out, it was just
              a large prop set for anyone who wants to take a picture of a classic 1990s Hong Kong Mcdonalds. Not only was that a funny and great first 
              impression of Hong Kong, but it is also a sign that I may probably have to learn the new customs and traditions here in this country 
            </p>
            <img  width="1280px" class="blog_pictures" src="https://hongkongcheapo.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2020/07/buses-taxis-iStock-495626994.jpg" alt="">
            <p class="blog_date">Our first obstacle was trying to navigate via their public transport. It isn't bad or anything. All bus stops and routes are clearly
              labelled with signs and they use electronic cards to make payment much easier for us. The only problem is that we are so used to the weird Jeepney system
              here in the Philippines that finding a much more efficient way of transport is such a hassle when we have the habits you get when travelling in a third world country.
              For example, bus stops here have clearly designated stops, and you can't just stop anywhere in between stations. You also just cannot cross roads because in regions 
              outside of Southeast asia, Jaywalking is a crime! I also had to brace myself whenever my Mom asks a question to the locals because:
            </p>
            <p class="blog_date">1. We could not speak their language</p>
            <p class="blog_date">2. Filipinos are too dangerously friendly of a human race, so seeing how other people outside of our country actually behave with strangers may shock my mom, and</p>
            <p class="blog_date">3. Asian countries, including my own, don't like being asked questions.lol</p>
            <p class="blog_date">I understand that this is behavior linked more towards our differences in culture and less about any form of malice, but 
              it doesn't minimize the cringe I get when she starts talking to a local. It's a good thing that in most cases, 
              they are willing to help us out and get stuff for us done despite most of them being busy doing work. I want to try and apologize for the added problems 
            we give them, but I know it will only make their planned work/schedule much harder.</p>
            <p class="blog_date">It's a good thing that I am good with directions, can read the english labelled directly below the chinese characters in all signs, and
              memorize stuff that we need to do later in the day. I basically acted like some demi-tour guide that is also visiting these places for the first time. But despite it 
              all, we went to multiple places around the region! On our first day, we went to Hong Kong Disneyland. I ate the worst burger there in spaceland (why was the bread RED?)
              and saw a cool parade and drone show there. Not much to see here that you cannot see when opening disney+ , but it only goes up from here.
            </p>
            <img width="1280px" class="blog_pictures" src="https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/ae/1e/d1/caption.jpg?w=1200&h=-1&s=1" alt="">
            <p class="blog_date">On our second day, we went to the Ngong Ping 360, a cable car ride that took use to a buddhist temple with a big Buddha statue. We met a lot of 
              south asians here as well that were just as friendly and accomodating as the locals, and we also looked at the grand set piece here in this landmark: a big buddha statue sitting on
              top of a mountain. It is the most majectic sights I've ever seen, especially when looking at it from the view of the cable car. It might be my favorite place in the entire trip, and I was
              willing to visit this place one more time if we had hours to spare. Then on the afternoon, we headed to hong kong island and rode a tram car up this steep hill, which gives us a good view of Hong
              kong's cityscape. This is where I was first exposed to Hong Kong's many shops and businesses, which had very tempting products to buy from. It was also here that I ate some steamed soy chicken, 
              mushroom and rice which is a new favorite dish for me. 
            </p>
            <img width="1280px" class="blog_pictures" src="https://cdn2.picryl.com/photo/2009/03/16/cultural-centre-kowloon-2009-5fa353-640.jpg" alt="">
            <p class="blog_date"> On the third day, we visited Tsim Sha Tsui. We rode a bunch of ferries and yachts just to cross the waters between 
              Tsim sha Tsui and Hong Kong itself. All the while, we visited the Avenue of Stars, took a photo in front of the bruce lee statue there,
              and admired the light show that happened on the evening. After eating this declicious waffle dessert they were serving in the Kowloon public pier, we
              took a tour bus around Hong Kong and saw a lot of public spaces that may catch my eye like the Ladies Market in Mong kok. We were having a good time, but realized that it is almost
              closing hours for the MTR line, and we need the train to bring us back to our hotel. We had to quickly leave Hong Kong to end the day, and we are lucky to catch the last train home.
            </p>
            <img width="1280px" class="blog_pictures" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e2/Kun_Iam_Ecumenical_Centre_02-05-2023.jpg" alt="">
            <p class="blog_date"> On our final day before depature, my mom decided that we should catch a ferry to Macao. We rode a bus and saw more iconic spots like the Macao Tower, the Guan Yin Statue, their science center,
              and multiple themed hotels. If I have one impression I've gotten about Macao, it is China's version of Las Vegas. They have their own mini Eiffel Tower, Roman Coliseum, and Big Ben while I was visiting the place.
              It is also the one place where Jaywalking is allowed (yay crimes!), and for our trip back to our hotel in Hong kong, we took a highway that crossed the Freakin sea. I just had to admire the people who has the audacity
              to build someting this wide in the middle of the freakin sea. 
            </p>
            <p class="blog_date">We went back to the Philippines on our fifth day, and this is where I wrap up my thoughts about the trip. I don't want people to think that this is just mindless glazing of China because
              despite its highs, there are some lows that can be identified when you look further down their history. However, as a tourist spot, it definitely nailed the Urban Holiday vibes I wanna look forward to during 
              Christmas season. The locals are accomodating and are really good at their job. They are never late for anything like arriving at a bus stop or train station, and there are a lot of engineering marvels to be
              seen when going to Macao and Hong Kong. To those wishing for a quieter and simpler environment, the Ngong Ping 360 may just be the place for you, and there are also other spots that I have not visited that are 
              just beautiful densely packed forests. The only thing that got me sour is that 5 days may be too long of a vacation trip, and by the third day, I was feeling a little bit homesick lol. Thankfully, we arrived at Manila
              safely, and the first thing I was greeted to was the hot scorching heat of the sun and the heavy traffic just outside of Newport City. How i missed this lol.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 30px;" class="blog_date"><b>May 14, 2025: CAD-CAM, The Batangas Province, and Research</b></p>
            <p class="blog_date">Since the last time I posted here in this blog, I am here to announce now that I am now officially NOT 
              addicted to Harvest Moon. I am still going to be making an HM Parody animation at some point, but I'll probably make fun of it 
              while making the script for it lel. Anyway, my addiction in this time of year is learning about computer aided design and manufacturing;
              specifically, studying about 3D Printing in dentistry and its associated programs and software. It only came about when I did a project in school wherein
              I made a group presentation about 3D Printing Resin in Dental CAD. I was already in a dentistry course, and my father introduced me to CAD way before, but I wasn't technically 
              having fun studying it because information about it was pretty scarce, and I was a brat that did not like learning new things. Fast forward to today, and I am now responsible for carrying a 
              group report in which I voluntarily proposed the topic to all of my 4 members that did not know anything about CAD or even 3D Printing, so I had to do all of the research, script, and powerpoint design
              on my own. It was hard and confusing at first getting to relearn the basics of 3D Printing again, but once I got deeper into the subject, I began to have fun teaching myself this modern workflow. I guess back then, I 
              was scared by the user interfaces of the different dental CAD Programs out there like blueskybio, but now that I've experienced more complicated workflows like building a website with Javascript code, I can now see that Dental 
              CAD is just a walk in the park. So when I presented my report to the entire class, my friends and classmates were interested in the many things I know about this complicated subject. When I finally completed my report, I got questions
              from starry-eyed colleagues asking me more about how the Dental CAD workflow works, and I happily answered all of them. I enjoyed teaching them about it, but I was also inspired by their curiosity and drive to know something that I,
              in the past, would disregard as nothing more than a fad. So as person with a newfound passion to teach people this skill that they may need in the future, I went about and learned more about CAD-CAM; I looked into the latest 3D Printers,
              Resins that may be biocompatible within the oral cavity, and reviewed blue sky bio's website to learn more about their software's modules. I am going to be livestreaming myself learning about blue sky bio's features, so if you are in the 
              medical field and want to learn how you can incorporated 3D printing into your workflow, I suggest going to my youtube channel!
              <p class="blog_date">Aside from that, I've also been strrugling with Math (Oh no!). So when I was in school, my biostatistics teacher had us do a sort of mini-research paper with a group. This group was different from my CAD report group, but they are cooperative
                enough to fill out the review of related literature, the abstract, the discussion, and the introduction to our paper. However, when it came down to analyzing and calculating the results, no one was willing to take the plunder. There was technically someone in 
                charge of writing the results section of our academic research, but the guy wasn't posting any of his calculations. When it finally reached the deadline, no one still hasn't done the maths, so I took it upon myself to record each one of the 120 respondents' raw results and 
                calculate them via this formula given to me by my professor to measure correlation between two variables. I had to do this twice because of how much data there was, but eventually I got the answers that my group desparately needs. However, when reviewing the results, I realized 
                that I made an error. Upon fixing it, which took a long time, a thought crossed my mind: what if I got the other calculatons wrong? So to substantitate my paranoia, I did the calculations twice more while reviewing the data sets that I inputted. I just got done finishing it this morning,
                and I dropped to my bed while trying to ignore the fear that maybe I still have some mismatched answers in my excel sheet.
                <p class="blog_date">Anyway, once I was done with all of my school work in my dental course, I had a long summer break ahead of me. To start off my vacation, I went to a mini-resort in Batangas wherein my family celebrated one of my lolas' birthday. We had a pretty big buffet which is a practice for 
                  every filipino celebration, and I got sick trying to eat some empanadas provided by the waiters. I felt horrible eating all of this food, so the next day, I woke up early in the morning and ran 10 kilometers. It has been a week since I ran or even exercise, so I thought that this is what I needed. However,
                  fast forward to today, and I am limping a little bit and having trouble getting up to bed because my leg muscles are a little bit sore. I think I should go easy on the workouts first before I continue running long distances lol.

            <p style="font-size: 30px;" id="blog_date"><b>Feb 26, 2025: Getting into Harvest Moon and  visiting a cool american diner</b></p>
            <p class="blog_date">During the duration of time since my last post, I have suffered from a great gaming addiction through a series I've recently discovered called Bukujo Monogatari, or what it's called in the west,
                Harvest Moon. I've discovered this series after replaying a bunch of GBA games like the ports of Donkey Kong Country to the system and some Castlevania Games, and I thought to myself that I have enough of the 2D Platforming 
                genre. So I looked for more comfy games on the system, and what I stumbled across was Harvest Moon: Friends of Mineral Town. I played the CRAP out of it. As someone who is unaware of the cozy game/ farming sim genre, this is a great
                first game to experience. People say that it only has the bare minimum of what to expect, but that bare minimum was enough for me to look into other games like Stardew Valley, Fields of Mistria, Sun Haven, and Rune Factory. What got me into 
                the series was the fact that I was having enough of the difficulty spikes of games like Fire Emblem, Castlevania, and Donkey Kong Country, and wanted something more easy-going and comfortable while also giving me a new experience unlike pokemon.
                So harvest moon was the answer for me, and I had fun just earning a lot of money from all the crops I planted, the stuff that I foraged, the minerals that i mined, and the machines that I built that made yarn, cheese, and mayo. If you want to experience and easy-going game,
                Harvest Moon (Or Story of Seasons) may be the game for you!
            </p>
            <p class="blog_date">Moving on, Valentines day has just passed, and I spent it with my family at a fancy looking diner in Makati, Philippines. My Mom found out about this place after
                going there with her coworkers, and she thought about how great the place was, and when I found pictures of this restaurant online, I thought that it looks like a really
            good place to visit! However, when we commuted to this place, I noticed that it is in one of the most sketchiest places in the whole city, which is P Burgos Street. If you are unaware, this 
        is one of the rare places here in the country that is considered a red light district. There weren't any R-rated scenes to stumble into, but there are bars, clubs, and women lining up the streets waiting for their
        eventual prey. The air of adult activity looms around this area, but luckily, my mom knew how to use google maps and eventually, she took us to the diner. The diner was family-friendly and have no people dressing up in lingerie
        whatsoever unlike in other places in this street. It really makes you wonder how such an attraction would be built next to these graphic buildings in the background.</p id="blog_date"> 
        <p class="blog_date">There was a long line, but we eventually got a table for me, my mom, and my two younger siblings. Entering this place, we found a vintage collection of anything american; from old movie posters, to replicas
            of iconic places in america, to even full-on vehicles ripped straight out of the mid-20th century. It was wild, and to top it off, all the employees were dressed to look like american icons from different eras. And to help sell their costumes to
            visitors, they would perform as if they were the characters that they embodied.There was a waiter that looked like Marilyn  Monroe from the 50s, and there was also an Elvis Presley lookalike singing a bunch of iconic songs from his discography. There was a guy
            dressed as chuckie that tried to "strangle" my little brother when he walked passed by, and there was even Mr. Bean that did funny Mr. Bean shenanigans (Although, he could be the most terrifying person in the establishment because the costume required the wearer 
            to wear this bubble head over his head that is supposed to look like the animated version of Mr Bean, but instead it more so resembles one of the animatronics from the FNAF franchise). 
        </p>
        <p class="blog_date">The enviroment really fits the american theme that they are going for. Sadly, The food did not really meet my expectations. The meals were definitely american sized, but the flavor and overall quality of the food reminded me of some fast food establishments here like
            tropical Hut and Shakey's. I also could have sworn that the burger that they gave me had an undercooked patty, but it could be the result of me telling the waiter to make the patty "medium rare." Either way, what I learned from this experience is that portion sizes really determine your 
            overall enjoyment for a meal, and I just think that the sizes for each meal we ordered, from the pizza to the burger to the milkshakes, were too big for my taste. Maybe if I were visiting this place after a long workout, I would have enjoyed the food much better. But this ain't my cheat day when 
            we visited, and I was feeling a little bit sick after our visit here to filling station.

            <p class="blog_date">Happy new year, everyone! 2024 was a good year, but we are now at the year of our lord 2025. The passage
                of time is upon us, and every year we are reminded how close we are to the time of our deaths in this finite life of ours lel.
                Anyway, how have you guys been holding up? I might as well explain what I've been doing during the weeks of my
                christmas break this year.</p id="blog_date">  
            <p class="blog_date">Starting from where we last left off, My family visited my mom's friend's christmas party. This friend
                of hers had an annoying little plump of a child (which I will call Po)that talked to us the moment we sat on their living room couch. He started showing
                us a bunch of 3D kids cartoons with unpolished shaders, then he began to play games with us. He brought out a jenga set wherein
                he took charge of who gets to have their turn. In some cases, he miscounted and starts having some of the players play twice in one turn, which
                is annoying but funny when it's someone that is not me. Then we started building stuff with the jenga blocks that laid on the floor after we knocked off 
            the tower. We had a pretty fun(ny) time playing with him, but as soon as we start to give gifts, he gave a present to one of the older people in the room (which I will call Jessica)
            It was a present made by hand by Po, so he was very ecstatic giving this present that he worked so hard on to Jessica. I looked at it and it was a crude bundle of paper taped together
        to look like wrapping. Wanting to make the kid happy, she opened the "present" and noticed that inside was another bundle of paper taped together. 
        Thinking that it was a small present inside a bigger present, she opened it as well, but then Po started to cry. He told her that it was supposed to be one of those 
        blind bags that he watched a bunch of youtubers open, and the smaller wrapping was supposed to be the toy inside. She quickly apologized for tearing apart his gift, but everyone 
    started laughing. Poor kid.</p>
    <p class="blog_date">Then when the party is over and we started to leave, this kid started to block the door out of the house. He did not want anyone to leave, and it made me sad 
        at first that he did not want us to go. I wondered if he had any friends, but what he did next was go up to his room, go back downstairs, and 
        slipped me a bunch of cash into my pocket. Apparently, he was bribing me to keep on staying here, and that really was the funniest event of the night for me, because when I checked how much 
        money he slipped, it was only about 3 pesos. I felt sad for the kid. Hope this kid gets minecraft for his birthday.
    </p>
    <p class="blog_date">After such a party, my mom had us visit a hotel for the holidays. We brought a bunch of presents at a hotel nearby, watched a bunch of netflix at our room, and swam at the rooftop swimming pool (it was 
        a pretty cold day when we visited the pool, and we only skinny dipped once). I was also able to go to their gym, which I don't really do that often. Most of the time,
        I am running or biking outside, so it was interesting for me to be at a room filled with heavy metal objects and a surprisingly lack of air conditioning. However, it was at this moment that I realized 
        how unfit I was because when I used the treadmill, I had a hard time keeping up with a 6:00 pace for a 30 minute run. That was a surpise for me, because back then, this was my easy pace whenever I 
        go out and run. I guess I need to stop eating Mcdonald's. But speaking of fast food, I tried out Mos Burger for the first time during my stay here at the hotel.
        There was a branch nearby, and I had one of the fluffiest burgers I've ever tasted. The taste was mid, but burgers are burgers, and fast food rarely screw up a good burger.
        <p id="blog_date">Shortly after our hotel escapade, it was time for me to go back into the college grind. Just this week, I started going back to campus with a new
            set of subjects to work with. It was then that I was given a whole list of things to bring to one of my subjects this semester. They were expensive and hard to find, and 
            it made me worry a lot about whether my parents wpould be willing to shell out a lot of money for this one class of mine. I also met a lot of classmates, both old and new, but if 
            there is a similarity between both the old and new people I've met, it's that I do not have any idea who they are. A normal thing for new faces, but a shock to old ones. One girl came up to me 
            and said that she was a classmate of mine last sem, and I was like "hoeh?" I have a hard time remembering people from my past, and it is only after a quick facebook search that I remembered who she really was lel.
        </p>
        <p class="blog_date">Overall, I'm excited for what this year will bring for me. I have 2 animations planned to release in the coming months, one 3D and one 2.5D, and I hope everyone will enjoy it!</p>

            <p class="blog_date"> Another day of me not updating this blog, huh? Well, might as well explain what I have been up to.</p>
            <p class="blog_date"> My mom dragged me to a bunch of events in the first week of december alone, with target audiences
                 of different age groups, so let us go through them one by one. In the first sunday of the month, I went with my little
                brother and sister to the movie theatre to watch "Wicked." It was my mom's most anticipated movie of the year because she
            just got into watching musicals last year, so she is on the hunt of consuming anything musical-related from Starkid to local
        theatrical plays she can find in a university nearby. When she heard that Wicked is getting a movie adaptation, she was livid.
        She started listening to the soundtrack while doing chores, and I always knew that she was awake just by the sound of Defying Gravity
        echoing from the kitchen lol. Then she cannot stop talking about wanting to watch Wicked with us until we finally got our 
        butts down the theatre and actually watched the movie. She was laughing hysterically at the jokes in a quiet theatre and was commenting
        on how good it was while we were watching. Honestly, I think it was a great movie, but my mom is a massive fan that even after watching the movie,
        I can still hear her listening to the opening song and "Popular," both the stage version and the movie version. To make fun of her, I asked 
        if she liked Wicked more or Twisted, the starkid parody of Aladdin, and she gave me a disappointing look that was priceless. Never again will I question her love
    for a 2003 musical released in Broadway.</p>
    <p class="blog_date"> One week after watching Wicked, my mom invited me to an official christmas party hosted by a well-known dental
        organization that she is affiliated with. Its venue was at a bar in Bonifacio Global City called "Yes, Please!" which I didn't know it
        was a bar until I arrived at the party. When I first heard of the event, I thought that it would be a formal gathering between dentists that
        she worked with before. But once I entered the dark room that was the christmas party, I was shocked by the image in front of me. So
        many dentists were drinking vodka and tequila at their tables while a well-known filipino musician from saudi-arabia was singing in front
        of a live band. After a while, people started singing karaoke and dancing at a room not built for dancing (the image below shows the layout of the bar.
        Even though there is a disco ball, there is just not any room for people to start dancing). Then as the night came to its deepest point, the host walked to
        the mic and introduced to everyone a special guest. It turns out, they were able to invite a well-known ACTRESS to the party. I was baffled by what just came out.
        And it is not like she does not know these people. She is actually friends with some of them, and I didn't know what to make up with this party. I have underestimated
        the power that these dentists have. It really made me rethink about society; the people we lend our money to and what these said people do with our money. Is this where 
        corrupt individuals come from, or am I just overthinking things? lel.
    </p>
    <p class="blog_date">Days after the party, my mom walked into my room while I was watching Youtube. She wanted to let me know that she was yet again
        invited to ANOTHER Christmas party by an affiliate dentist. This time however, she is planning on bringing my little siblings, which implies
        that this is a more family-friendly event. But as she announced this to me, she also notified me of a talent competition happening 
        during the party which she plans on all of us joining. She thought of having us wear teletubbies costume while doing a square dance as "September"
        by Earth, Wind, and Fire plays in the background in front of a live audience. It was an insane idea to think about as I write it, but after all the insane things
        that my mom did during these first few weeks of december, I thought, "Sure, why not?" We practiced a little bit and are still waiting for our costumes to arrive. I
        will tell you guys how it goes on Saturday when the event actually takes place.
    </p>

    <p class="blog_date">I'm practicing more and more of my coding skills and slowly completing a 2D wrestling animation short I plan on releasing next year. Binge-watching youtube is what's delaying me from completing these
        projects any sooner, but now that Christmas break has arrived, I may have the chance to get more work done!

            <p style="font-size: 30px;" class="blog_date"><b>October 31, 2024: Candlewick, Failing to Help Someone Cheat, and Others</b></p>
            <p class="blog_date">Hi, guys. A lot of things happened to me while I was away. But I wanna talk about a recent funny story I had involving 2 classmates
              of mine, a quiz that we weren't prepared to take, and the most epic fail I had in this year.
            </p>
            <p class="blog_date">One day, my professor in university announced a pop quiz for us to study in oral pathology. Like any pop quizzes, the classmates (including me)
              are not prepared for the quiz. It shocked everyone, including the 2 persons sitting next to me. However, the teacher was nice and gave us 2 hours to study before
              the exam. My seatmate scoot over to me and whispered in my ear. People knew me as the smart person in the room. While I do not get the best grades in class, it is 
              most likely guaranteed that I pass all of my quizzes and exams. My seatmate knew this, so he came up to me and asked, "Hey, can you help me cheat on the exam?" Me, being 
              afraid to say no to the guys because I do not want to get into their bad side, reluctantly said yes to the request. But in the back of my mind, I was figuring out how I should
              get out of this situation. The teacher can just catch us if we are not careful, and even if I'm not the one cheating, I may be charged for helping someone cheat. Luckily for me, 
              a series of wacky events happened that made sure that I did not help them in the long run.
            </p>
            <p class="blog_date">First of all, the original plan was for them to sit right and left of me while the quiz took place. This is so that they can
              properly see my test paper. However, the teacher announced right before the quiz to distance ourselves with each other. I was positioned
              at the back of the class while she announced this, and my bad hearing thought that the announcement was directed toward the three of us, only for me
              to realize after the exam that it was an announcement for the entire class. It could have been anyone that moved, but my dumb brain interpreted it as
              a signal for me to move to another location away from the two idiots I have by my side. One of the cheating duo noticed me move, so she followed me from
              behind and sat at a seat behind me. I didn't notice her follow me, so I was thinking "well, the plan already failed." Meanwhile, my seatmate tried to
              look at my quiz, only to realize that I was writing using a pencil, and compared to writing a pen, it is hard to read pencil handwriting from a distance.
              add that to my crappy handwriting, and what I get is a bulletproof exam that cannot be cheated on.
            </p>
            <p class="blog_date">My seatmates came up to me after we exited the exam room, and I thought that they would be angry at me. Turns out, they were
              laughing their asses off because of how ridiculous and dumb my decisions were when I tried to help them cheat. TLDR, don't ask me to help you cheat, because
              even if I agree, I may figure out a way to screw it all up lmao.
            </p>
            <p class="blog_date">In other news, its spooky month. And I figured that I should share an old animation of mine called "Candlewick." It is a
              2.5D animated film that I made in february of this year that was more so a passion project of mine. If you guys like horror, you may be interested
              watching it here!

            <p class="blog_date"> 
                Hello! Long time, no see! I haven't been making things in my site lately, so I took it upon myself to revitalize this 
                site by posting my very first post in the blog section of this site! A lot of things happened while I was gone. 
                I released a new BGM album called "Medical Students" which was the reason why I withhold making this website for a very 
                long time. I also made a few more scenes for an upcoming 2D animation project, but I think I can finish it by around 
                january of 2025 (2D animation is hard). I also am doing a lot of school work lately, one of which requires me and a 
                group of guys to start a podcast wherein we talk about oral pathologies for 30 minutes. 
                I am tempted to share to them my background in making content online, but I do not know if I can show to them that I am 
                a vtuber without having the feeling of cringe and embarrassment overtake my consciousness. 
                So I'll probably just help in editing everything for them without explanation as to why I know a lot about 
                audacity or da vinci resolve lel.
            </p>
            <p class="blog_date">
                For future projects planned (aside from making the animation I previously mentioned) I want to get back to making some 
                more video essays/tutorials. One of them I am calling "Making DAW Music (For Dummies)" or something along 
                those lines wherein I go in-depth onto my process of making music while explaining a little bit about DAW
                programs and music theory along the way. I also want to do another video dedicated to explaining my journey making a 
                website from start to finish. It would be interesting since prior to this, I did not have any background on
                coding or anything computer-science related. However, I will wait until I at least remembered HTML and CSS after a 
                four-month hiatus from coding, finished bro code's tutorial on javascript and polish my site more 
                before I start making a script for that.

              Had a tiring day at school today. I still had energy tho to quickly

              to make this webpage better, and I have to say that I am looking
